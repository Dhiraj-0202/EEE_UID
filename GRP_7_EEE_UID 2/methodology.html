            <li align ="left">The ADXL335 accelerometer sensor collects hand movement data by detecting tilt and motion in different directions.</li>
            <li align ="left">The Arduino Nano processes the sensor data and converts it into movement commands, which are sent wirelessly via the RF transmitter.</li>
            <li align ="left">The RF receiver in the car receives the signals from the hand controller, and the Arduino Uno interprets the data to determine the car's movement.</li>
            <li align ="left">The motor shield controls the gear motors, allowing the car to move forward, backward, left, or right, powered by a 9V battery, while the hand controller uses a 3.7V battery.</li>
            <li align ="left">The system is tested to ensure the car responds correctly to hand gestures, with adjustments made to improve accuracy and reduce delays.</li>
