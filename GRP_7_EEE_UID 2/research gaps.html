        <h1>Research Gaps</h1>
        <ul>
            <li align="left">Gestures Can Be Misread â€“ The system may sometimes get confused between similar hand movements.</li>
            <li align="left">Slight Delay in Response â€“ The car may not move instantly because the RF module takes time to send signals.</li>
            <li align="left">Limited Control Distance â€“ The RF module has a short range, so the car can't be controlled from very far away.</li>
            <li align="left">No Smart Learning â€“ The system follows fixed rules and does not improve its accuracy over time.</li>
            <li align="left">Accidental Movements Can Cause Errors â€“ If the hand moves suddenly, the car might take the wrong action.</li>
        </ul>
